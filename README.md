# gulp-webpack-yawp

Yet another Webpack plugin (for Gulp)

## Motivation

After some time using `webpack-stream` I hit a limitation with it: The vinyl object piped out is not the same one as the one piped in.

I need some custom properties on the vinyl objects for my gulp setup, so this was a show stopper. The custom properties were not available after the files were piped into the plugin.

I decided to fix this problem and PR, but as I read and understood the code I decided to change so much stuff that it was beyond a PR.

`webpack-stream` creates some basic webpack configuration that applies. `gulp-webpack-yawp` does not.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This plugin only works with Webpack 4.

### Installing

```
npm i --save-dev gulp-webpack-yawp
```

### Usage

Example gulp task:
```
const
  { src, dest } = require( 'gulp' ),
  webpack = require( 'gulp-webpack-yawp' );

exports.default = function compileJs() {
  return src( 'src/js/*.js' )
    .pipe( webpack())
    .pipe( dest( 'output/' )
}
```

#### Plugin options

The plugin accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

| property     	| type    	| default     	| values                       	| description                    	|
|--------------	|---------	|-------------	|------------------------------	|--------------------------------	|
| webpack      	|  object 	|      --     	|              --              	| Webpack instance              	|
| wpConfig     	|  object 	|      --     	|              --              	| Webpack configuration          	|
| logMode      	|  string 	|   'silent'  	| 'silent', 'stats', 'verbose' 	| Webpack log mode              	|
| statsOptions 	|  object 	| [see below] 	|              --              	| Options for log mode 'stats'   	|
| verbose      	| boolean 	|    false    	|              --              	| Plugin verbose mode              	|
| watch        	| boolean 	|    false    	|              --              	| Use webpack in watch mode      	|
| watchOptions 	|  object 	| [see below] 	|              --              	| Options for watch mode         	|
